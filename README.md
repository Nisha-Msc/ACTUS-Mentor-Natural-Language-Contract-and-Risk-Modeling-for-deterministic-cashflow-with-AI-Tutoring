# ACTUS-Mentor-Natural-Language-Contract-and-Risk-Modeling-for-deterministic-cashflow-with-AI-Tutoring
ACTUS Mentor uses AI to generate ACTUS request bodies and risk factors from natural language, validated against ACTUS dictionary and applicability rules. ACTUS performs deterministic cash flow computation and netting. AI Mentor then assists with XBRL compliance reporting. Built-in tutoring explains each step.

🎯 Vision
Our vision: AI-assisted end-to-end financial contract modeling with deterministic computation at the core.
ACTUS Mentor bridges the gap between natural language understanding and regulatory compliance while maintaining 100% deterministic, auditable calculations through ACTUS standards.
