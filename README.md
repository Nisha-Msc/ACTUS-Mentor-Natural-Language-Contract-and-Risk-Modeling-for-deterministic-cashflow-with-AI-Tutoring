# ACTUS-Mentor-Natural-Language-Contract-and-Risk-Modeling-for-deterministic-cashflow-with-AI-Tutoring
ACTUS Mentor uses AI to generate ACTUS request bodies and risk factors from natural language, validated against ACTUS dictionary and applicability rules. ACTUS performs deterministic cash flow computation and netting. AI Mentor then assists with XBRL compliance reporting. Built-in tutoring explains each step.

# Natural Language Processing:
Convert plain English contract descriptions into ACTUS-compliant request bodies
# Risk Factor Generation: 
AI-powered risk scenario modeling from natural language inputs
# ACTUS Validation: 
Automatic validation against ACTUS dictionary and applicability rules
# Deterministic Cash Flow Computation:
Calculate precise payment schedules using ACTUS standards
# Cash Flow Netting:
Automated netting of multiple contract cash flows
# XBRL Compliance:
AI-assisted generation of regulatory compliance reports
# Interactive AI Tutoring:
Step-by-step guidance and explanation throughout the workflow

# Our vision: 
AI-assisted end-to-end financial contract modeling with deterministic computation at the core.
ACTUS Mentor bridges the gap between natural language understanding and regulatory compliance while maintaining 100% deterministic, auditable calculations through ACTUS standards.
